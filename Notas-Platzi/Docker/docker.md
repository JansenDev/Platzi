# Docker
## Problems when building:
- Development dependencies (packages)
- Runtime versions
- Equivalence of development environments (code sharing)
- Equivalence of production environments(go to production)
- Versions / compatibility(integration of other services e.g.: databases)

## Problems when distributing:
- Different build generations
- Access to production servers
- Native vs. distributed execution
- Serverless

## Problems when executing:
- Application dependencies
- Operating System Compatibility
- Availability of external services
- Hardware Resources
- Docker allows:
- Build, distribute and run your code anywhere without worrying.
